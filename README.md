# Analysis of Resignation Rates in Singapore
<br>
The Great Resignation refers to a global workforce trend where a significant number of employees are voluntarily leaving their jobs during or towards the end of the pandemic. This analysis was initiated following the Great Resignation to take a deeper look into the resignation trends in Singapore.

In our analysis, we have looked into the resignation rates in Singapore over the years, across industries and occupations, as well as in relation to other workplace factors. An Rshiny App was created to enable users to explore these trends. We hope that through the analysis, it can better inform the Singapore Government and related service providers on the trends and underlying reasons that might be driving resignations. Ultimately, we aim to empower decision makers to tailor manpower policies to meet the needs of different industries, and in the long run, attain Singaporeâ€™s larger economic goals.
